(e) other relevant circumstances.

The certificate has five sections for the entry of causes of perinatal deaths,
labelled (a) to (e). Diseases or conditions of the infant or fetus should be
entered in sections (a) and (b), the single most important in section (a) and
the remainder, if any, in section (b). By ‘the single most important’ is meant the
pathological condition that, in the opinion of the certifier, made the greatest
contribution to the death of the infant or fetus. The mode of death, e.g. heart
failure, asphyxia or anoxia, should not be entered in section (a) unless it was
the only fetal or infant condition known. This also holds true for prematurity.
All diseases or conditions of the mother that, in the certifier’s opinion, had
some adverse effect on the infant or fetus should be entered in sections (c)
and (d). Again, the most important one of these should be entered in section
(c) and the others, if any, in section (d). Section (e) is for the reporting of any
other circumstances that have a bearing on the death but cannot be described
as a disease or condition of the infant or mother, e.g. delivery in the absence
of an attendant.">
